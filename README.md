  ## Description
  The intention behind this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Node.JS by using node package manager to create a command-line application that can create a descriptive ReadME. Using Node.JS is essential for this project as its asynchronous event-driven Javascript can recieve and send data to quickly create an application. This intention behind this assignment is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Node.JS for server-side developments by creating scalable applications at a seemingly instant speed. By completing this project I am now able to use Node to create server-side applications that can take into account data from users or even APIS.
